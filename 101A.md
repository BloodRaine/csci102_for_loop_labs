BattleShip Game Flesh out later

you can clear the python shell using the following:

```
import os
os.system('cls')  # For Windows
os.system('clear')  # For Linux/OS X
```

Pseudocode
Create a 2D list (list of strings) (5 strings of length 5 all the same character)
prompt player 1 for 5 row, col coordinates
clear the shell
prompt player 2 for 5 row, col coordinates
Change 2D list at those locations to be a different character than the initial characters (this is your ship)
while game is not over
  ask player for a row and column position
  if the character at that location is a ship
    change
