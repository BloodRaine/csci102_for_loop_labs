# Ancient Cryptography

Cryptography is often thought of as computer protection, preventing hackers from accessing your personal data.
However, it is actually much more and is an older conept than you may be aware of.
By definition Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication.
This means that as long as anyone has had need of keeping some information secure, 
there has also been some kind of cryptography associated along with it.

For this Assignment we will be creating several cryptographic methods to obvuscate out secret messages
and prevent them from being understood.

you will be asked to impliment the following cryptographic methods of obscuring messages:
- The Scytale
- The Ceasar's Cipher
- Your own secret message scrambler

In order to achieve the end result of our encoder, we will want to make use of for loops, while loops, Strings, lists, and any other python syntactic sugar we have covered thus far.

*If you would like to impliment the various encryption and decription methods as functions you are welcome to do so if you know how, however, this is not a requirement and you will not gain additional points by doing so*

# Part 0 - The Setup
This assignment is going to have several parts to it. Each of these sections is the recommended way of designing your program.
While the entire program may be complex, breaking it down into smaller chunks can help make a hard problem seem much simpler.

For Part 0 the goal is to create the basic flow and structure of our program. This will include:
- infinite loop to keep the user in the program constantly
- prompt the user for what type of encryption they would like to perform
- conditionally checking that input to send the program into different sections of code depending on what was asked
- In the case of encoding a message, prompting the user for a message to be encrypted"
- creating sections (comments) in the code for where the implimentation of each cipher will be put

For simplicity just take in a number for various options
0 - Scytale Encription
1 - Ceasar's Cipher
2 - Custom Encryption
3 - Quit

In the case of quit, `break` out of the while loop.

A simple infinite loop can be made sung `while True:`, just be sure to break out of it. While testing, if for some reason you never hit a `break` you can press control + c (like copy for copy and paste) this should stop the execution of the program.

**NOTE: Assume that the space character " " falls at the end of the alphabet after zed such as: 'x', 'y', 'z', ' ' <--**

# Part 1 - Scytale Encryption

In the 7th century B.C. through the early 1st century A.D. The Greek's, and Spartan's in particular
had a method of secretly delivering messages across the battlefield. In some cases, generals would 
encrypt hidden messages by wrapping leather belt around a rounded object of a very specific diameter 
and write their message vertically, when unwound, they would then fill in the spaces between the letters 
with random letters. Only by wrapping the belt around an object of the same diameter could the message 
then be read. The belt would then be worn until it reached its destination. If the messenger was killed 
and someone somehow noticed they had markings on their belt, they may have a hard time figuring out
the message without knowing how to crack the code.

For part 1, The goal is to create a section in our code structure created in part 0 that if chosen as the encryption method will generate a hidden message as described above.
for this you will need to:
- Ask the user for the circumfrence (how many characters in between each real character)
**Note: there will need to be some random characters before the first "real" character to hide the beginning of the message**
- use a loop to gernerate random characters to put after each real character.

# Part 2 - The Ceasar Shift Cipher
*Hint: you may want to use a nested for loop to generate the random characters n times while still looping over the input string*

The Caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar to protect messages of military significance (wikipedia on Ceasar's cipher)
This is known as the shift cipher as it has to do with shifting the alphabet by a certain number and then converting what would have been at a location to it's new character. An example would be a ceasar shift on the english alphabet right by 3. In this case, the letter 'A' would map to the letter 'D' The letter 'B' to the letter 'E' and so on.

For part 2 of this lab, you will need to:
- Ask the user for the direction to shift the cipher **AND** the value for the cipher to be shifted.
- Construct the alphabet shifted in the correct direction by the correct ammount without simply setting something like the following: `shiftedAlphabet = 'DEFGHIJK.....ABC'`
- use a loop to perform the translation from your message to the encoded message.

# Part 3 - Create your own

For Part 3 of this assignment you are tasked with designing your own (or implimenting another known) encryption method!
Be creative and think about how you would best like to hide your secret messages. Your Encryption method must:
- Include at least one for loop
- Be a string to string conversion of some kind, so no strings to numbers or anything quite as tricky as that.
- Use the English alphabet, (If someone knows how to type hieroglyphs on a computer all the power to you but not for this assignment)

In a seperate .txt document, describe your encryption method, what it does that is different, and why you chose to use it over other methods

Zip together your code along with your README.txt and submit that to canvas titled yourName_AssignmentX.zip
