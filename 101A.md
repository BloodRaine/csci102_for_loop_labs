# Ancient Cryptography

Cryptography is often thought of as computer protection, preventing hackers from accessing your personal data.
However, it is actually much more and is an older conept than you may be aware of.
By definition Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication.
This means that as long as anyone has had need of keeping some information secure, 
there has also been some kind of cryptography associated along with it.

For this Assignment we will be creating several cryptographic methods to obvuscate out secret messages
and prevent them from being understood. Likewise, given an unreadable message and a bit of information about how 
it has been tampered with, we will also translate the message to find out what kind of sinister secrets it holds.

The goal of this assignment is to impliment the following cryptographic methods of obscuring messages:
- The Scytale
- The Ceasar's Cypher
- Your own secret message scrambler

In order to achieve the end result of our encoder/decoder, we will want to make use of for loops, while loops, Strings, lists, and any other python syntactic sugar we have covered thus far.

*If you would like to impliment the various encryption and decription methods as functions you are welcome to do so if you know how, however, this is not a requirement and you will not gain additional points by doing so*

# Part 0 - The Setup
This assignment is going to have several parts to it. Each of these sections is the recommended way of designing your program.
While the entire program may be complex, breaking it down into smaller chunks can help make a hard problem seem much simpler.

For Part 0 the goal is to create the basic flow and structure of our program. This will include:
-  prompting the user if they would like to send a string to a certain type of encryption and 
get the encrypted message back, or if they would like to send in a sample string to attempt to be cracked.
- conditionally checking that input to send the program into different sections of code depending on what was asked
- creating sections (comments) in the code for where the implimentation of each cypher will be put
- creating a loop for if the user chose to crack a code that will eventually run the input through our decoding algorithms.

# Part 1 - Scytale Encryption

In the 7th century B.C. through the early 1st century A.D. The Greek's, and Spartan's in particular
had a method of secretly delivering messages across the battlefield. In some cases, generals would 
encrypt hidden messages by wrapping leather belt around a rounded object of a very specific diameter 
and write their message vertically, when unwound, they would then fill in the spaces between the letters 
with random letters. Only by wrapping the belt around an object of the same diameter could the message 
then be read. The belt would then be worn until it reached its destination. If the messenger was killed 
and someone somehow noticed they had markings on their belt, they may have a hard time figuring out
the message without knowing how to crack the code.

For part 1, The goal is to create a section in our code structure created in part 0 that if chosen as the encryption method will generate a hidden message as described above.
